## Introduction

As a passionate VFX and Shader Artist, I strive to push the boundaries of visual storytelling through the power of computer-generated imagery. In this portfolio you can find a demonstration of the use of various shader and visual effects techniques.

## Technologies

- Unity Editor itself
- C# language for some effects and custom inspector for other developers.
- Shader Graph for creating most of the shaders.
- Visual Effect Graph for creating, you guessed it right, visual effects
- HLSL for writing shaders that cannot be created in the shader graph.

## Usage

Open this project using Unity 2022.3.10f1 and feel free to explore. Main scene placed /Assets/AlexandraPortfolio/Exposition.unity
